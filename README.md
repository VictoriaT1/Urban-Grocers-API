# Sprint 7 project


This is a JEST API testing suite for the Urban Grocers App. The endpoints are being tested for PUT, POST, GET and DELETE and each endpoint has 2 tests.

To set up the environment before creating the test is as follows:
After linking Practicum account with GitHub, a repository will be created automatically. The repository name will be hm07-qa-us.

The next step is to create a directory to store all projects. After the directory is made, you will then  create a folder called projects.
Next you will  change the directory into the new projects folder and clone the repo using git clone git@github.com:username/hm07_qa_us.git
After cloning the repo, run npm install from the console into project folder.
Then, in config.js replace the API URL with the unique link generated for launching the server for Urban Grocers.
Provide the API URL in config.js which is imported in the test cases
Documentation used is apiDOC
Select an API endpoint for each test and write two test; check the response status code and parse the response
Use postman to check the endpoint and observe the response body and check expected data
Variable names clearly describe what is stored in them. If the project has several variables with similar data, those variables have unique but descriptive names
Function names are descriptive and reflect what they do and start with a verb.
run npx jest to check tests in VS studio

8/8 test passed.
